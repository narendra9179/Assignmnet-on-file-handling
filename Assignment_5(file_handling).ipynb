        "\n",
        "* Flushes Data to Disk:\n",
        "\n",
        "   When you write to a file, Python buffers the output in memory for efficiency. Calling .close() (or exiting a with block) forces those buffers to be flushed, ensuring all your data is actually written to disk rather than sitting in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Releases System Resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Every open file consumes an operating‑system file descriptor (a limited resource). If you leave files open, you risk running out of file descriptors, which can prevent you from opening new files or sockets.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Prevents Data Corruption:\n",
        "\n",
        "  If a program crashes or exits without closing files, you may end up with partial writes or corrupted files, because buffered data never made it to disk or metadata (like file size and timestamps) wasn't properly updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Avoids Locking Issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "  On some operating systems or when using network or database file systems, an open file may be locked and inaccessible to other processes. Closing the file releases those locks, allowing others to read or write.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Good Practice & Predictability\n",
        "\n",
        "  Explicitly closing files (or using with open(...) as f:) makes your code’s resource management clear and deterministic, reducing the chance of subtle bugs in longer‑running applications.\n",
